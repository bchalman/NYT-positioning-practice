        <p>Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence
           of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and
           so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named
            Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late
            with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
            the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
            evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
            force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
            from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
            out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double
            box around it.

              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
              beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation,
              looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes
              at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
              Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
              gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it
              was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
              that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
              wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the
              recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
              It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years
              in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
              larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
              universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity,
              like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
            beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
            according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of
              the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded
              in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
              that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
              and as hot as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background
              Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing
              at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
              Astrophysical Journal.

              The Theory of Inflation

              <p><span>THE UNIVERSE</span>is just under 14 billion years old. From our
                position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion
                light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
                temperature.</p>
              <p><span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>The universe is not old enough for light
                to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there
                has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
                temperature.</p>
              <p><span>DISTANT COFFEE</span>At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope
                to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you
                can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>

              <img src="images/inflation.png">
              <img src="images/fluctuation.png">
              <p><span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>There has not been enough time to carry
                coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow
                filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
                temperature.</p>
              <p><span>INFLATION</span>solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less
                than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed
                of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale
                structures of the universe.</p>
              <p><span>FLUCTUATION</span>Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
                fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left
                over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such
            a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations
            and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts
            of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his
            office last week.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said
            Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant
            of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean
            last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on
            his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we
            did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order
            it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
            “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
