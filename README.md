# Positioning and Floating elements

From The Odin Project - [Positioning and Floating Elements](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements?ref=lnav)

The New York Times has been a leader in experimenting with the inclusion of multimedia content in traditional stories. That creates all kinds of interesting position questions.

In this project, your assignment is to copy [this article from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0)(open in an “incognito” window without cookies to view it if you’re over your monthly limit).

Note: As usual, ignore any ads, comments or interactive elements (which use Javascript) and don’t worry about what happens when you change the page width (they use some media queries to rearrange things). Focus on making it look similar.
